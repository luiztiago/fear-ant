# Fear Ant

Animated Ant using CSS3 transitions with keyframes.

**Works only on Firefox 23+ because the `devicelight` event is only implemented on this platform**

## How to test

* Open index.html on your Firefox browser :)
* Type how many ants you want to create
* Turn off your ambient lights
* See the show!

**You'll need a light sensor on your device (such as a camera).**

## How it works

* [Docs of the Ambient light event](http://www.w3.org/TR/ambient-light/)
